For statics class, we were asked to design a structure with a linear actuator, a rod, and 3 pins, in a 2D space of 50cm by 150cm to lift the greatest load to the highest height possible.

I ended up choosing a design of a lever to allow me to lift the load to the max height of 50 cm, while still applying the maximum load possible.
